# My Favorites of 2017

## Things I enjoyed in 2017

By all accounts, 2017 was a horrible year. One of the worst I've experienced. Yet, as far as my own personal life was concerned; it wasn't bad!  At the end of each year, I like to close the year out on a positive note, and take tally of things that I enjoyed the most. One thing I do each year, starting in early November, is start to pore over the various top whatever clickbait lists that everybody releases - especially pertaining to music. This helps me catch up on stuff that I missed (which is a lot).

I don't like ordered lists, so I'm just going to alphabetize this stuff.

### Favorite TV Shows

I don't get to watch very much TV, so this is a short list. I considered just adding one show, but decided to just roll in some older shows that I caught up on in 2017.

The one show I was going to add was _The British Baking Show_.

This show undoubtedly had the most profound impact on my life this year. It was just the kind of comforting escapism I needed to contrast the bileous news coming out of Washington D.C. all year. It also inspired my wife to up her baking game, and I enjoyed all of the many products of her labor.

Some other shows I enjoyed were:

* **Game of Thrones** _I finally caught up on this, having avoided season 7 spoilers. I felt like it really lost something after it broke from the books - felt rushed, I guess - but I can't say the whole thing wasn't enjoyable._

* **The Expanse** Season 2 _This show is great. I can't wait for season 3. Good for fans of Game of Thrones and new jack Battlestar Galactica. Politics in space with a white-walkers element._

* **The Knick** Season 1 _Very grim show, with moments of comedy. The direction by Soderbergh, and music by Cliff Martinez is top notch._

#### Stuff not released in 2017

This is the fun list. This is mostly what I _really_ listened to in 2017, unconstrained by release date. Listening to music with my daughter steered my music taste immensely this year. Whether I liked a song or not; if _she_ liked it, I listened to it more than anything of my own.

#### Songs
* Slowdive - Sugar for the Pill - _The first time I played this in the car, it was for my wife, but my daughter liked it immediately and insisted on listening to it, like, twenty more times until I had it memorized and had to stop it for my own sanity_

* Orchestra Baobab - Fayinkounko - _This song takes the cake. Definitely more times than anything that wasn't from a kid's program. She loved it from the moment she first heard it and I've loved this band for years, so it was a perfect match. I'll always remember 2017 as the year we danced to this song._

* Supertramp - Dreamer - _OMG she loved this song. We watched the live video [link], we listened to it in the car, in the bathtub - everywhere. I've always loved this song, and it actually stood up to hundreds of listens this year._

* Justin Hinds - Hurry go home

#### Albums

Supertramp - Crime of the Century
Matthew Bower stuff
Jamaican First Wave stuff
GAS - Pop



### Computer games

* Overwatch _It continues to please. Blizzard just keeps throwing more content_
* The Division _Ubi has done a great job keeping the DLC coming. The things I'm reading about the 1.8 patch (free) convinced me to reinstall the game._
* Doom _This game is hard as hell. I love it. It's just like old school Doom - the game that got me into PC gaming._

### iOS Apps

* **Ripplemaker** by Brambos [link] _This "West coast style" modular synth is pretty easy to figure out out of the box, because the basic connections are already made. All you have to do is change the routing around. One can make some amazingly ugly and beautiful noises with this synth. Might not be the best if you're looking for generic techno/trance sounds, but great if you're a fan of modern modular musicians like Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith or M. Geddes Gingres._

* **Moog Model 15** AUv3 update [link] _This free update to Model 15 (released in '16) changed everything for me. Breathed new life into this app, which was amazing before, but constrained by IAA functionality. I never thought this would receive an AU version, because of screen scaling and just CPU limitations, but it runs just fine. Just the other day Moog added the ability for it to be loaded as an AU Effect (again a free update), meaning you can use it to modulate and filter anything that can be routed through its audiobridge channels. And, because its AU, there are as many instances as your device can handle._

* **Synthscaper** [link] _I'll admit: I haven't figured out how to do much with this app yet. The UI is completely unorthodox. However, even as inept as I am, I have turned things like a sample of me hitting a railing at the park with a stick into a chimey drone._

* **Rozeta** AU MIDI suite [link] _This one got off to a rocky start, having had to rename itself like three times. It feels like Brambos is giving away his/their work with this one: It's a bundle of awesome little MIDI sequencing tools that work via AU, which means they can be loaded infinitely. You can sequence the sequencers sequencing synths loaded into sequencers. The amount of noise you can make with these is ridiculously fun. These seem especially well-suited to creating generated music._
